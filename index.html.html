<h1>FRONT END</h1>
<h3>HTML:</h3>
<p>HTML Stands for hyper text markup language. It is used to create the structure for the website.</p>
<p> It acts as a skelton. It is used to create webpages, it consists of series of elements which is represented by tags</p>

<h3>CSS:</h3>
<p>CSS Stands for Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used with HTML or XML documents.
<P>It allows for the separation of content from presentation, influencing layout, colors, and fonts.</P>
<P>CSS operates on a rule-based system: styles are determined by rules that consist of selectors and declarations.</P>
<P>This separation promotes content accessibility and streamlines the structure of documents.</P></p>

<h3>JAVA SCRIPT:</h3>
<p>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and much more on web pages</p>
<p>It is a single-threaded, synchronous language widely used in web development, playing a crucial role in both front-end and back-end development</p>
<p>JavaScript is interpreted through web browsers, making it highly accessible and versatile</p>

<h3>REACT.JS:</h3>
<p>React, also known as ReactJS, is a popular and powerful JavaScript library used for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces, primarily for single-page applications (SPAs).</p>
<p> It was developed and maintained by Facebook and has gained significant popularity due to its efficient rendering techniques, reusable components, and active community support.</p>

<h1>BACKEND</h1>

<h3>NODE.JS:</h3>
<p>Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser.</p>
<p>It was released in 2009 by Ryan Dahl and has since become a popular tool for building server-side applications
</p>
<h3>PYTHON:</h3>
<p>Python is a high-level, interpreted, and object-oriented programming language known for its simplicity and readability.</p>
<p>It is Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has become one of the most popular programming languages due to its versatility and ease of use.</p>
</p>
<h4>Python Key Features:</h4>
<p>Python's syntax is designed to be intuitive and easy to learn, making it an excellent choice for beginners</p>
<p>It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming</p>
<p>Python's dynamic typing and dynamic binding capabilities make it suitable for Rapid Application Development</p>
<h3>JAVA:</h3>
<p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere,meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.</p>
<p>Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages.</p>

<h1>DATABASE</h1>

<h3>SQL:</h3>
<p>SQL stands for Structured Query Language, a language designed to manage and manipulate databases.</p>
<p>It allows users to:</p>

<p>1.Execute queries</p>
<p>2.Retrieve data</p>
<p>3.Insert, update, and delete records</p>
<p>4.Create new databases and tables</p>
<h3>My SQL:</h3>
<p>MySQL is a widely-used open-source Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) that utilizes Structured Query Language (SQL) for database operations. Developed by MySQL AB and now owned by Oracle Corporation, MySQL is known for its reliability, speed, and ease of use. It is a key component in many web applications, forming the backbone of popular websites and services.</p>
